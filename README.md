# Generalizable Functional Tissue Units (FTU) Segmentation
The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is working to catalyze the development of a framework for mapping the human body at a level of glomeruli functional tissue units for the first time in history. HuBMAP aims to be an open map of the human body at the cellular levelD.  Link to the kaggle competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/hubmap-kidney-segmentation
